# Warning - Project No Longer Maintained

It has been a while since this project saw any updates and I have no intention of ever coming back to this.

I still think that a WYSIWYG fomod editor is a worthwhile goal so I'll gladly help anyone who wishes to venture into these untamed lands. My advice, do not fork this repository - it was my very first programming project, the code is a mess. Here are some resources that you might find useful:

- [pyfomod](https://github.com/GandaG/pyfomod)
- [fomod-docs](https://github.com/GandaG/fomod-docs)
- [fomod-schema](https://github.com/GandaG/fomod-schema)

If another project with a similar goal reaches maturity, I'll update this notice.

Thanks for using or at least checking out the FOMOD Designer - it was a nice dream, but it's time to let go.
